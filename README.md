## Introduction

* This application can be used to keep track of your ideas. The two fields required are the title of your idea and the text of your idea. Once this is submitted, the application will build a list of ideas with the most current idea at the top. Saved ideas are also editable with the ability to modify the text and body. Ideas can be 'upvoted' and 'downvoted' according to the quality (swill -> plausible -> genius) and you may also delete them as you see fit. You can filter through your existing ideas by using the search bar.
